We have brought this relationship to a new starting point and we share the aspiration to carry it forward to future generations,” he said.\\n\\nTowards that, Li highlighted four proposals that both countries can focus on to build a stronger relationship going forward.\\n\\nThe first, he said is to enhance the traditional friendship and consolidate the foundation for bilateral relations.\\n\\n\"It is important to keep to the right direction in growing this bilateral relation, respect each other\\'s core interests and major concerns, build stronger political mutual trust, and pursue wide-ranging cooperation in the context of building a China-Malaysia community with a shared future,” he said.\\n\\nSecondly, Li said there is a need to synergise the development strategies of the two countries while expanding on their mutual interests.\\n\\n\"It is important to develop greater synergy between the Belt and Road Initiative and the Madani Economy Framework, step up trade in agricultural and other products, and tap the potential for cooperation in emerging areas, such as green energy and advanced manufacturing, to deliver more benefits to our two nations,” he said.\\n\\nOn the third suggestion, the Chinese premier highlighted on the need to deepen exchanges and mutual learning to promote further understanding of the people in the two countries, including in the fields of arts and culture, tourism, education and sports.\\n\\nFourthly, Li proposed for a strengthened solidarity and coordination between China and Malaysia in the international arena to address global challenges together.\\n\\n\"China is ready to work with Malaysia to advocate for an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation, and jointly build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful, amicable and harmonious home in Asia.\\n\\nLi, who is in the country for a three-day official visit since Tuesday (June 18), recalled that 50 years ago, Malaysia had withstood the Cold War pressure to establish a formal relationship with China, taking the lead among Asean countries.\\n\\nToday, the ties have remained strong across all fronts, with both nations continuing to steadfastly support each other through hard times while emphasising the relationship is based on win-win cooperation.\\n\\n\"Over the past 50 years of diplomatic ties, China and Malaysia have treated each other with kindness and sincerity, and have remained good neighbours, good friends and good partners.\\n\\n\"Our two countries have rendered each other firm support in exploring the development paths suited to our national conditions. Ours is a fine example of relations between the countries in the region,” he said.\\n\\nLi also noted that China has been Malaysia\\'s largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years.\\n\\nHe highlighted that fruits from Malaysia like durian and mangosteen are famous among Chinese consumers.\\n\\n\"Through mutually beneficial cooperation, our two countries have both achieved growth and built ever closer economic ties, which have created a strong impetus for our respective modernisation drive,” he said.\\n\\nIn 2023, China remained Malaysia\\'s largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years since 2009, with a trade volume of RM450.84bil (US$98.90bil).\\n\\n\"Going forward, China will march ahead together with Malaysia towards modernisation, champion friendship as the overarching theme in our bilateral relations, and write a new chapter of a shared future,” he said.\\n\\nThis is Li’s inaugural official visit to Malaysia since taking office in March 2023.\\n\\nThe visit coincides with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Malaysia and China, following the signing of the Joint Statement between second prime minister Tun Abdul Razak Hussein and then-premier Chou En Lai on May 31, 1974.\\n\\nMalaysia\\'s diplomatic relations with China have strengthened since the upgrading of bilateral relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2013. - Bernama',\n 'section': 'News',\n 'category': 'Nation',\n 'content_tier': 'Complimentary',\n 'content_length': 'Medium',\n 'authors': None,\n 'published_date': '2024-06-19 00:00:00',\n 'keywords': 'Li Qiang,Anwar Ibrahim,China,Malaysia,Anniversary',\n 'summary': 'KUALA LUMPUR: China will continue to work with Malaysia in advancing their friendship and bilateral relations for mutual benefit and a brighter future for both nations, said its Premier Li Qiang.',\n 'url': 'https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/06/19/chinese-premier-says-malaysia-china-relations-exemplary-proposes-four-steps-to-advance-ties',\n 'top_image': 'https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/06/20/2757820.jpeg'}"

Theater chain AMC shed 11% following an 88% surge since Friday's close.\n\nBoth the shares were to set to shed half of their gains made in the first two sessions of the week following a series of posts from Keith Gill's X account \"Roaring Kitty\", whose bullish calls on GameStop was a reason for the 2021 meme stocks frenzy.\n\nUnlike 2021 when Reddit users banded together to target highly shorted stocks that burnt the bearish bets of hedge funds, institutional investors too are part of the meme stock mania, Vanda Research, which tracks retail investor flows, said.\n\n\"The short sellers three years ago were completely surprised by the magnitude of the mass purchases and ultimately overwhelmed by the size of the short squeeze,\" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments.\n\n\"They have likely learned from that experience and left themselves less exposed thereby reducing the potential for extended upward pressure.\"\n\nShort interests, or bets on a stock's decline, have stayed rather flat for both GameStop and AMC this week, analytics firm Ortex Technologies said.\n\nShort sellers took unrealized losses worth $1.14 billion this week from their bets against the two struggling companies and were set to make just about $460 million in paper gains on Thursday, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, hedge fund Renaissance Technologies placed a new bet for GameStop shares to rise further and significantly increased its long position in AMC during the first quarter.\n\nGameStop stock was still nearly 70% below its 2021 peak, while AMC, which hit a record low last month, was 98% off its all-time high.\n\nSince his first post on Sunday, Gill has put out more than 50 movies clips on X.com. He did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on what the posts mean and whether he planned on making his investments public again.\n\nFormer U.S. SEC Chair Jay Clayton told CNBC on Wednesday the posts have triggered \"a wave of euphoric and speculative buying in the retail (trading) community which is never a good thing\", adding that it was not illegal to say \"I like a stock\".\n\nOther highly shorted stocks that caught a bid this week were lower on Thursday. Tupperware fell 6%, while U.S.-listed BlackBerry and SunPower shed about 2% each.\n\nOPTIONS TRADERS RUSH IN\n\nOptions activity remained strong. GameStop and AMC were among the top ten securities with highest options volume by 11:15 a.m. ET, with majority of traders buying call options, which bet on a stock's rise, data from Options Clearing Corp showed.\n\nThe pace of borrowing for margin trading by U.S. investors, however, has been restrained compared to the GameStop short squeeze in January 2021, J.P.Morgan strategists said in a note.\n\n\"Retail investors are once bitten twice shy after they ended up losing a lot of money last time round,\" said Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at digital brokerage eToro.\n\n\"Even though there are more retail investors today, you're not seeing that follow through into the rally this time as you saw last time.\"\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh and Pranav Kashyap in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)'\n\n'>> targets: Policies can help China hit GDP goal'\n'>> task_type: CHINA has room to pursue a more proactive fiscal policy and an expansionary monetary policy, thereby boosting economic recovery and helping achieve the targeted economic growth of around 5 percent this year, experts said on Tuesday.\n\nThey made the remarks after the Government Work Report announced the economic expansion goal on Tuesday. The report was delivered by Premier Li Qiang at the opening of the second session of the 14th National People's Congress, the country's top legislature, in Beijing.\n\nThe country will intensify proactive fiscal policy as appropriate with improved quality and efficiency, and exercise a prudent monetary policy in a flexible, moderate, targeted and effective manner, the Government Work Report said.\n\nIt set the projected deficit-to-GDP ratio at 3 percent for 2024 and targeted a whole-year inflation rate of around 3 percent.\n\nWith this planned fiscal deficit rate, the deficits are expected to reach 4.06 trillion yuan ($560 billion) this year, with an increase of 180 billion yuan from the deficits for 2023 budgeted at the beginning of last year.\n\nThe general public budget expenditure is planned to be 28.5 trillion yuan, increasing 1.1 trillion yuan from that of last year.\n\nThe report also said adequate liquidity will be maintained at a proper level, while aggregate financing and money supply will stay in step with the projected economic growth and increase in the consumer price index.\n\nXu Gao, chief economist at BOC International, said: \"The main challenge facing the Chinese economy is weak demand with underlying issues of tepid investment and dampened confidence. With that, it's crucial to step up efforts on expanding investment to boost economic recovery.\n\n\"The intensity of fiscal policy has been increased modestly from last year, and I expect stronger fiscal policy later this year to better achieve the economic growth target.\"\n\nChang Haizhong, executive director of corporates at ratings agency Fitch Bohua, said the targeted deficit rate is lower than market expectations, reflecting the government's determination not to engage in short-term strong stimulus, and to promote high-quality development.\n\nSu Jian, a professor of the School of Economics at Peking University and director of the university's National Center for Economic Research, said the government debt plan unveiled on Tuesday is relatively more conservative than many had expected, and yet it is understandable as the country needs to strike a balance between the objectives of stabilizing economic growth and containment of local government debt risks.\n\n\"This means elevating the efficiency of stimulus will be a focus,\" he said, adding the authorities may take more measures to boost consumers' spending propensity and lift private businesses' investment willingness so that the same amount of government spending can generate increased private investment and consumption.\n\nHowever, if factors like the issuance of special treasury bonds are taken into consideration, the actual fiscal expenditure will likely expand to an appropriate level this year, experts said.\n\nAs for monetary policy, Zhu Haibin, chief China economist at JPMorgan, forecast a continuation of growth-friendly interest rate policy and credit policy this year, including two 10-basis-point policy rate cuts — with the next rate cut likely this month — and another reserve requirement ratio cut in the second half of this year.\n\nZhu said the recent establishment of a credit management department in the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, will continue to provide targeted support in five key areas: technology finance, green finance, inclusive finance, pension finance and digital finance.\n\nLeon Wang, executive vice-president of AstraZeneca, a global biopharmaceutical major, said the company looks forward to investing and expanding in China, while working with local partners to promote Chinese innovations globally. - China Daily/ANN'\n\n'>> targets: Cricket-Afghanistan pick six all-rounders in T20 World Cup squad'\n'>> task_type: (Reuters) - Afghanistan have packed six all-rounders, including captain Rashid Khan, in their 15-member squad for the T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies in June.\n\nIbrahim Zadran, Najibullah Zadran, and the wicketkeeping duo of Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Mohammad Ishaq were the only four frontline batters in the squad unveiled on X on Tuesday night.\n\nAfghanistan will hope the presence of all-rounders Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Karim Janat and Nangeyalia Kharote will add depth to their batting.\n\nMujeeb-ur-Rahman and Noor Ahmad will join Rashid and Nabi in Afghanistan's formidable spin attack, which is likely to be key to their performance in the 20-team tournament.\n\nTop-order batter Hashmatullah Shahidi, who led Afghanistan in the 50-overs World Cup in India last year, did not make the squad.\n\nAfghanistan begin their Group C campaign against Uganda on June 3.

It will be tabled during the Budget 2025 announcement in October.\n\n“I too was a victim of a price hike after the Prime Minister’s announcement,” said Md Salleh.\n\nHe said he had gone for lunch at a well-known asam pedas restaurant in Gelang Patah and ended up paying RM74.20 for two people.\n\nMd Salleh said the bill was for two pieces of asam pedas ikan merah (red snapper), a small piece of omelette, mixed vegetables, two plates of rice and plain tea.\n\n“We had a similar order at the same place in March and it only cost RM50,” he said.\n\nHe suggested that consumers cook at home to save money or choose eateries with reasonable prices.\n\nJohor Bumiputra Consumer Association chairman Syed Abdullah Syed Mohamed said traders would increase their prices every time the government announced bonuses or salary increases for civil servants.\n\n“It is expected as it has been going on for years,” he said.\n\nSyed Abdullah said the price of a packet of basic nasi lemak with sambal and a small piece of omelette had increased.\n\n“The same nasi lemak sold at a food outlet at Bandar Baru Uda was RM2 each before May 1 but on May 2, I paid RM5 for two or RM2.50 each,” he said.\n\nSyed Abdullah said he expected another price increase this December once the new salary scheme for civil servants was implemented.\n\nThe authorities, he said, should take action against traders and food operators for increasing prices indiscriminately.'\n\n'>>> Title: ‘Avoid eateries that hike prices excessively’'\n\n'>>> Generated Title: Traders advised to be more selective when eating out'\n",

What if my date from last weekend thinks I’m arrogant for writing a text like that?\n\nInstead, maybe not texting or talking to them at all will make things easier. But for whom? Mostly just for the one doing the ghosting.\n\nIt can happen to anyone, and Charlie’s Angels star and talk show host Drew Barrymore revealed in a 2022 interview with People magazine that she, too, had been a victim.\n\nEarly in the 2000s, the term “ghosting” emerged in the Western dating scene to describe when someone suddenly cuts off all communication and contact without any warning or explanation.\n\nGhosting is not the same as a breakup, says psychologist Anja Wermann, who herself was ghosted at the end of 2020.\n\n“When you split up, you usually see it coming, you might have a conversation to end the relationship. When it comes to ghosting, however, the reason for ending things is never given,” the psychologist says.\n\nSince 2021, Wermann has been running a therapy centre called the Ghosting Ambulanz (outpatient clinic) for people who’ve been ghosted.\n\nThe majority of her clients are women between their late 20s and early 50s, with some men also coming to seek her advice. Some people find it hard to move on from being ghosted years after the event.\n\n“Being ghosted always hits hard,” says relationship psychologist Eric Hegmann. “If there is one phenomenon today that stands for the fear of non-commitment when getting to know someone, it’s ghosting.”\n\nHe also knows the shame people feel after being ghosted. Ghosting is such a “widespread phenomenon” that it is referred to as a “plague” in the dating world, he says.\n\nEven though a short-lived relationship may end this way, the silence leaves its mark on future relationships.\n\n“People often complain that being ghosted makes it more difficult for them to trust new people,” says Hegmann. And what’s more: “I have clients who report severe symptoms such as weight loss, dizziness, physical pain, loss of appetite and insomnia.”\n\nThis is why ghosting is being talked about more and more in terms of health and mental health. Health insurance companies are providing advice about it, and there are podcasts and social media pages dedicated to the topic.\n\nThis makes it clear that the belief that ghosting someone will spare the other person pain is wrong. “It’s more the other way round: It takes you longer to get over being ghosted than if you had been given a clear no or goodbye,” explains Wermann.\n\nGhosting may sound like a new phenomenon, but it’s really a new name for an old thing. People used to talk about being abandoned or jilted, or that someone simply walked out on them.\n\nThere is a difference, however: “It has never been so easy to make contact with other people,” says Hegmann. The Internet and apps make it possible to meet people you would otherwise never have met. And it’s just as easy to disappear without a trace.\n\nThis would be different if there was some kind of social control because you know the person from your extended circle of friends, for example. “However, it’s never the medium that does the ghosting, but the person,” Hegmann points out.\n\n“After I was ghosted once, my perspective changed,” says Wermann. “I would now always write: ‘I’m sorry, it’s not going to work out.’ I think clear communication is always better.”\n\nFor Wermann, it also helped her to believe that she might understand the experience in the future. “And in the meantime you try to move on with your life and focus on the positive.” – dpa/Weronika Peneshko'\n\n'>>> Title: Berlin’s clinic for the dating scene’s ‘plague’'\n\n'>>> Generated Title: Soccer-Ghosting is a new phenomenon'\n",
